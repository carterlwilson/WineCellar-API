# WineCellar-API

This is an API that can be used to store, add to, and remove bottles from a collection of wine the user owns. Built for learning, and for fun.
- Built using NodeJS, Express, and PostgreSQL.

This is very much a work in progress, planned features include:
- rating system
- official wine scores attached to each bottle
